# KeyBowMini-Pico-CircuitPython

Read about the original 12-key keybow project at [Codepope's Development Hell](https://codepope.dev/post/revamping-pi-keybow-into-pico-keybow/)

I used a Waveshare Pico-to-HAT since the originally suggested pico hat never came back in stock. Note there aren't any pictures of the waveshare pico-to-hat adapter with a pHAT attached, but the HAT is rotated 180 degrees so that it will not overhang the Pico.  i.e. the keybow keys are hanging over the edge of the adapter board. https://www.waveshare.com/product/raspberry-pi/boards-kits/raspberry-pi-pico-cat/pico-to-hat.htm

the GPIO numbers changed according to https://pinout.xyz/pinout/keybow_mini#
